# Rust conversion of virt-manager

## Destination

A locked, hand-off-ready build spec for a full Rust rewrite of virt-manager
(GUI + `virtinst` core + `virt-install`/`virt-clone`/`virt-xml` CLI tools),
targeting Linux only, matching the existing GTK UI's screen layout and
behavior closely, with full driver parity across whatever libvirt backends
`virtinst`/domcapabilities expose (QEMU/KVM, Xen, LXC, bhyve, etc.) — not the
working code itself, which gets handed to `/to-spec`/`/to-tickets` once the
map's tickets are resolved.

## Notes

- Domain: virtualization management (libvirt/QEMU-KVM), desktop GUI + CLI tools.
- Upstream reference: virt-manager 5.1.0, installed source at
  `/usr/share/virt-manager` on this machine (`virtManager/` 28.9k LOC GUI,
  `virtinst/` 24.4k LOC core+CLI, 31 GtkBuilder `.ui` files). Upstream repo:
  https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager (pull `tests/` from there —
  not shipped in the installed package).
- Skills every session should consult: `grilling`, `domain-modeling` for
  ticket resolution; `research` for research tickets; `to-spec`/`to-tickets`
  once the map is clear.
- Reference project for Rust GUI conventions (predates GTK-fidelity decision;
  superseded by ticket 05's `gtk4-rs` choice, kept only as a pattern
  reference for non-widget-tree concerns like async plumbing):
  `~/Downloads/watermark_pro-main/` — eframe/egui, single App-struct-per-window,
  `rfd` for file dialogs, texture-blit pattern for image display.
- GitHub remote: https://github.com/BrunoGrande/Virt-manager-rust (Claude
  GitHub Actions integration installed). Tracker is local-markdown regardless
  (no `setup-matt-pocock-skills` config in this repo) — map and tickets live
  under `.scratch/rust-conversion/`, not GitHub Issues.
- **Resolved tickets get amended by later ones when research surfaces new
  facts, rather than re-litigated.** Live amendment chain so far: ticket
  02 ← amended by 09 (event-registration gap's real fix is binding
  `libvirt-glib`, not the hand-rolled FFI shim ticket 02 originally
  concluded with); ticket 10 ← amended by 12 (concrete shape of the
  live/persistent duality ticket 10 could only defer); ticket 05 ←
  amended by 14 (pure-Rust-first console rendering didn't survive contact
  with the actual crates — both VNC and SPICE ended up gir-bound). Check
  a resolved
  ticket's full file, not just its map bullet, before treating its
  original conclusion as final — amendments live in the ticket file, the
  map bullet is a summary that gets updated alongside.

## Decisions so far

- [Destination](./map.md) — locked build-spec, Linux-only, close GTK UI
  match, full libvirt driver parity. (See Destination section above; this is
  the map's own founding decision, not a separate ticket.)
- [GTK4 console-widget availability](./issues/01-gtk4-console-widget-availability.md) — no: neither `gtk-vnc` nor `spice-gtk` has a GTK4 build, on any mainstream distro. A `gtk4-rs` UI gets no free console widget either — kills the main premise for choosing it over `egui` on that basis. Ticket 05 is now unblocked.
- [virt crate API coverage](./issues/02-virt-crate-api-coverage.md) — full coverage of migration/snapshots/nodedev/secrets/storage/capabilities; the one gap is domain/network/nodedev/secret/storage-pool event registration. **Amended by ticket 09**: upstream actually solves this via `libvirt-glib` (gir-bound, no GTK in the link chain), not a hand-rolled shim — bind it instead, for however much of the gap its `domain-added`/`domain-removed`/`started`/`stopped` signals cover.
- [Upstream test suite inventory](./issues/03-upstream-test-suite-inventory.md) — ~316 golden-XML fixtures (254 CLI compare + 62 xmlparse round-trip) spanning QEMU/KVM/Xen/LXC/Virtuozzo/bhyve/HVF and a wide OS/device matrix; this is the acceptance-bar corpus for the Rust port. Ticket 06 is now unblocked.
- [libosinfo bindgen feasibility](./issues/04-libosinfo-bindgen-feasibility.md) — practical: pure GObject C API, no GTK in the link chain, tiny init sequence, osinfo-db is a separately-versioned distro-installed data package with its own update tooling. Feeds the OS-detection/create-VM-wizard fog once tickets 05/06 land.
- [GUI toolkit choice](./issues/05-gui-toolkit-choice.md) — `gtk4-rs`: neither toolkit gets a free console widget (ticket 01), which cancels out both the "free widget" case for `gtk4-rs` and the "avoid GtkVnc/SpiceClientGtk binding risk" case for `egui`; on the remaining ~95% of the app, `gtk4-rs` gets close-GTK-match fidelity (theming, HIG, AT-SPI) by construction. Console rendering originally planned pure-Rust-first; **amended by ticket 14** — in practice both channels ended up gir-bound.
- [XML modeling approach](./issues/06-xml-modeling-approach.md) — typed structs bound to XPaths via a derive macro, reading/writing through a mutable order-preserving DOM built on the `edit-xml` crate. Neither original option alone satisfies ticket 03's acceptance bar (byte-exact round-trip of untouched XML, `virt-xml --edit` preserving foreign `xmlns:qemu` elements) without converging here anyway — this gets Rust compile-time field safety plus upstream's preserve-the-rest-of-the-document behavior, without porting xmlbuilder.py's runtime dynamic-dispatch descriptor engine.
- [GUI screen inventory](./issues/07-gui-screen-inventory.md) — the map's 15-screen list is really 17 top-level screens (`docs/research/gui-screen-inventory.md` has the full `.ui`-to-controller table) plus a 13-item shared sub-widget layer the original list missed. Inventory only, no per-screen specs yet — those are separate tickets, opened as needed.
- [Create VM wizard](./issues/08-create-vm-wizard.md) — `GtkStack` state machine, hand-written transition/skip `match` functions (one real skip rule), incrementally-mutated `WizardState` (plain struct, `Option<T>` fields, no typestate), `InstallMethod` enum-of-structs for compile-time-exhaustive per-method fields, `Guest` built directly at Finish bypassing ticket 06's DOM layer (nothing to preserve on a fresh document). Spun off the async-detect-gate question as ticket 09 and deferred the "customize before install" handoff to the not-yet-opened VM-details-window ticket.
- [Async / background-task model](./issues/09-async-background-task-model.md) — two separate problems: libvirt's own event loop binds `libvirt-glib` via `gir` (what upstream actually does, found in `virtmanager.py`'s bootstrap — amends ticket 02); blocking-call offload is plain OS threads + `glib::MainContext::channel()`, no `tokio` (every `virt` call is synchronous, nothing for a runtime to multiplex). Cooperative `Arc<AtomicBool>` cancellation, one shared progress-modal wrapper all long-running calls route through, matching upstream's `asyncjob.py` exactly.
- [VM details window](./issues/10-vm-details-window.md) — `GtkListBox` for the `hw-list` sidebar (a dozen-ish rows, not `ListView`-scale), direct port of upstream's pending-edit/Apply architecture (edits scoped to the selected row, confirm-or-discard on switch), a per-`HW_LIST_TYPE` `Option<T>`-field pending-edit struct (not an enum-of-structs — row fields can be simultaneously dirty, unlike ticket 08's mutually-exclusive `InstallMethod`). Remove Device is immediate, routes through ticket 09's async wrapper. Spun off Snapshot management as ticket 11 and deferred the live/persistent (`AFFECT_LIVE`/`AFFECT_CONFIG`) config duality to the `virtinst-core` ticket. **Amended by ticket 12** with that duality's concrete shape.
- [Add Hardware wizard](./issues/12-add-hardware-wizard.md) — `enum NewDevice` (17 mutually-exclusive variants, same compile-time-exhaustive pattern as ticket 08's `InstallMethod`), companion-controller dependencies folded directly into a variant rather than a bolted-on side-channel. Found and ported the concrete live+persistent attach pattern (`attach_device()` then always `add_device()`, degrading to persistent-only on hotplug failure) — the answer ticket 10 had deferred. Device-default dispatch stays opaque, deferred to the not-yet-opened per-driver-defaults item.
- [Snapshot management](./issues/11-snapshot-management.md) — resolved by verified precedent, not a fresh grilling round (see ticket file for the source checks this rested on, including a first-read widget guess that source-reading corrected before it got written down). `GtkListBox`-with-custom-row-widget for the snapshot list (one rendered column, not the six-column tabular grid it first looked like; confirmed no parent/child snapshot tree is displayed), create/revert/delete already on ticket 09's `vmmAsyncJob` rails, `enum NewSnapshot` for the mutually-exclusive internal/external/disk-only creation modes, snapshot-XML construction opaque-deferred to `virtinst-core` same as ticket 12's device defaults.
- [VM Manager main window](./issues/13-vm-manager-main-window.md) — row-activation dispatch, live-stats feed, and delete/context-menu actions settled by precedent (tickets 09/10). The one real fork — this is the app's only genuine two-level tree (connections → VMs), not a flat list like tickets 10/11, and `gtk4-rs` still ships (deprecated-since-4.10 but present, verified against the actual GTK4 typelib) `TreeView`/`TreeStore`/`CellRenderer*` — decided **`GtkListView` + `GtkTreeListModel` + `GtkTreeExpander`** over the deprecated 1:1 port; the custom `CellRendererSparkline` becomes a small `GtkWidget` subclass drawing via `snapshot()`, bound per-row through a `GtkListItemFactory`.
- [Console-viewer implementation specifics](./issues/14-console-viewer-specifics.md) — SSH tunneling is just shelling out to the system `ssh` binary (`os.fork`+`os.execlp`, verified in `sshtunnels.py`), no crate needed. Checked the actual crates rather than trusting ticket 05's names: `spice-client`'s audio/clipboard/USB-redirect are unimplemented and upstream genuinely uses all three, so SPICE escalates to gir-bound `libspice-client-glib` immediately. VNC likewise: `vnc-rs` is `tokio`-based (conflicts with ticket 09's no-async-runtime decision), `whitequark/rust-vnc`'s own README admits no auth/encryption at all — decided to skip pure-Rust VNC entirely and bind `libgvnc` via `gir` too. **Amends ticket 05**: both console channels end up gir-bound, not pure-Rust-first as originally planned.
- [virtinst-core module/crate boundaries](./issues/15-virtinst-core-crate-boundaries.md) — one crate, not several (no proven need yet to pay workspace/versioning overhead for a split), internal modules mirroring upstream's own `virtinst/` package layout almost 1:1: `devices`/`domain` (typed structs per tickets 06/08/12), `connection` (wraps `virt` + `libvirt-glib` per 02/09, also where ticket 12's attach+persist pattern and ticket 10's deferred live/persistent duality land), `osinfo` (wraps `libosinfo` per 04), `install` (backs ticket 08's `InstallMethod` variants), `capabilities` (feeds per-driver defaults). `xmlbuilder.py`/`xmlapi.py` explicitly not ported — ticket 06 already rejected that engine. The shared async-job wrapper (09) stays GUI-shell, not core — it shows a modal, `virtinst-core` has no GTK dependency. Flagged, not solved: the CLI tools (`virt-install`/`virt-clone`/`virt-xml`) are in the map's own Destination but no ticket has touched them yet.

## Not yet specified

- Per-screen specs for the remaining 12 screens + 13 shared widgets ticket 07 located.
- [CLI tools](./issues/16-cli-tools.md) — ticket 16, open. `virt-install`/`virt-clone`/`virt-xml` are explicitly in the Destination but haven't had a single ticket's attention — argument surface, how they share `virtinst-core` with the GUI, `virt-xml`'s edit-in-place semantics (the actual reason ticket 06 needed the order-preserving DOM in the first place).
- Per-driver device-default behavior (QEMU/KVM vs Xen vs LXC vs bhyve differences in add-hardware/create-VM options) — lands as a method on each `virtinst-core::devices::*` type per ticket 15, parameterized by `capabilities::DomCaps`; the per-driver logic itself still needs its own pass.
- Packaging/release process.

## Out of scope

- Non-Linux platforms (Windows/macOS) — virt-manager's real usage is
  managing local/remote libvirt hosts from Linux; a non-Linux build would
  only ever do remote connections, a different product shape. Decided
  2026-08-04.
